# convert-image-into-seamless-tileable-texture
Turn a texture image, such that it can be tiled seamlessly into uniform texture. Basically, change the image boundary regions to hide the stitching line in the image's native patterns.
This is taking the boundaries of the image and changing them so that opposite sides of the image will merge seamlessly, this is done by using the image topography to create stitching lines that follow the image's native patterns and as such much less conscious and  harder to detect.
